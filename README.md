Collection Tracker App
The Collection Tracker app is a simple web application that allows users to track their collection items. Users can add new items, view their collection, delete items, and calculate the total value of their collection. The app uses a server to store the data in a JSON file.

Features
Add items to your collection: Enter the item name, image URL, description, value, and category to add a new item to your collection.

View your collection: The app displays your collection items in rows with 5 items per row. The items are arranged in a card-like format with their images, names, descriptions, values, and a "delete" button.

Delete items: Each item card has a "delete" button. Click the button to remove an item from your collection.

Calculate total value: Click the "Calculate Total Value" button to calculate and display the total value of your entire collection.
